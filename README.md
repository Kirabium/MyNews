Jetpack compose with basic MVVM architecture

# Stack
- Retrofit for API calls
- Livedata / Viewmodel for MVVM 
- Jetpack compose for UI
- coil for the image in jetpack compose
- Mockito / Junit for testing

#TL;DR
Really simple architecture with a very simple design, I didn't overkill the project with baseActivity / Dependence injection libraries / Coroutines, I kept it simple with basic MVVM tools.
